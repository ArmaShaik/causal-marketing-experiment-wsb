# Experiments & Causal Methods: Email Marketing A/B Test for WSB Enrollment

This project presents a randomized A/B test designed for the **Wisconsin School of Business (WSB)** to assess the effectiveness of email marketing strategies in boosting enrollment in the **Actuarial Science Capstone Certificate Program**.

---

## 🎯 Business Context

WSB sought to increase enrollment in its actuarial science program and wanted to evaluate whether **email subject line framing** could improve user engagement and drive admissions. Our team designed a field experiment simulating a real-world marketing scenario to provide data-driven recommendations.

## 🧪 Experiment Design

- **Population:** 8,904 alumni from WSB and the College of Engineering (classes of 2016–2020)
- **Unit of Randomization:** Cluster-level (by graduation year and school)
- **Treatment Arm (Incentive Framing):**  
  “Fast-track your actuarial certification and earn $100,000+ annually.”
- **Control Arm (Neutral Framing):**  
  “Earn your actuarial certification with WSB in just one year.”
- **Primary Metrics:**
  - Email Open Rate  
  - Click-Through Rate  
  - Cookie-Based Page Visits  
  - Final Enrollment (matched by email)
